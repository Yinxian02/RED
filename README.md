# 🏠 RED Project Borneo

## Welcome to RED's GitHub page! 

Founded in 2015 within Imperial College London's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, RED is a student-led initiative dedicated to tackling education disparity in rural Borneo. Our mission centers on developing educational infrastructure and empowering students to apply their skills in real-world settings.

At RED, we believe in the transformative power of education and engineering. Our projects not only enhance educational facilities but also foster the practical skills and knowledge of our student volunteers.
